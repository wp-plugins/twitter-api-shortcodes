THEME

ERROR HANDLING
- Consider a theme for displaying errors in the place of a tweet or twitter search.  Probably allow it to be disabled.
- Universal way to handle rate limit exceptions.

SINGLE TWEET

ADMIN AREA
- Implement avatar updates using OAuth and a user list

SEARCH
- Plan for (and eventually implement) grabbing searches from google's twitter search.  Right now it isn't completely built out, but when it is we can use it, rather than caching searches.
- jQuery pagination of searches from the shortcode.

MISC
- Figure out how to use oAuth, without giving away my secrets - http://alexking.org/blog/2010/06/10/twitter-tools-oauth-update

OAUTH & PhoneHome
- Add an explanation about why I want to phone home, what's included, and an opt in (not out)
- Add an explanation about why I use oathgw (Googe App Engine app)
- Add the ability for the user to supply their own twitter application key & secret if they don't wanna use oathgw
