Twitter API Shortcodes depends upon the Smarty PHP templating engine.  Since we're good little boys and girls, we won't
include the library with the plugin, so you'll have to go get it yourself! But don't worry, it's not hard simply go to;

http://www.smarty.net/download.php

And grab the latest stable version.  Twitter API Shortcodes was built using version 2.6.26, but it's probably safe to
assume that any 2.6.x version of Smarty will do.

Once you've got the latest version, extract the zip, or tar.gz file, and copy the contents of the "libs" directory to
